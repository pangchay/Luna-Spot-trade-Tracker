# Luna-Spot-trade-Tracker

--- Info...
hoping this will become my first full app. 
The app will take input of your spot purchases and price of luna at the time. 
It will then return you the current price of Luna, total spent, your purchases, profits per purchase, Luna held, total portfolio profit, portfolio balance.




--- To do's...
Develop a menu so you can choose what token to track/input data or view purchases, balance etc 
going to add the ability to save your input instead of inputting everytime you launch.
will use pyinstaller to make it a standalone application.
